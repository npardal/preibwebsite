# TIPS FOR TEAMMATES, by Edwin

## Starting the server to see your code

---
WHEN YOU FIRST GET THE CODE RUN THIS
```bash
npm install
```
OR
```bash
npm i
```


TO RUN THE DEVELOPEMENT SERVER (see the website on your computer), RUN THIS IN THE TERMINAL:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Getting Started

---

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn to use Next.js

---

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.



## Deployment

---

The [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) can be used to deploy the server.
